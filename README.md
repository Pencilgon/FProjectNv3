# Notes-List

Notes-List is a CRUD application with user authentication, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete notes. It features user registration, login functionality, a recycle bin for deleted notes, and a user page with personal data and logout.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot framework.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Authentication:** Spring Security with JWT tokens for user authentication and authorization.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for performance and prepares it for deployment. The build output is minified and includes hashes in filenames.

Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for further details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
